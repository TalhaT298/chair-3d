## Description
This React application leverages the Three.js library to build an interactive 3D chair customization experience. The App component orchestrates the canvas setup, integrating a 3D chair model (Chair component) and a user-friendly configurator (Configurator component) for selecting chair material, color, cushion color, and leg style. The Chair component dynamically applies textures to the chair model based on user preferences, utilizing the Three.js library. The Configurator component offers an intuitive interface using a context API for state management. The Experience component incorporates the chair model and enables user interaction through the PresentationControls component. Overall, this code showcases the integration of Three.js with React to create an immersive and customizable 3D chair experience.
